# GW-PythonExamples
Example python code demonstrating some of the techniques I used during my research on gravitational waves.

The notebooks contain descriptions and explanations meant for researchers familiar with gravitational wave astronomy.
For those less familiar with gravitational waves, the general purpose of the notebooks is to simulate signals from a
variety of binary black hole sources, with various different physical properties (mainly their masses and spins), and
quantify how similar those signals look to each other.

The purpose of my research was to begin a process of developing a method which would improve the sensitivity of current
techniques for detecting gravitational waves from precessing black holes (precessing = a gyrating orbital plane). Thus,
knowing which precessing signals look very different to non-precessing signals (which we can detect much more easily)
is important.

These notebooks show some of the techniques I was using to identify the precessing signals which were most obvious.
